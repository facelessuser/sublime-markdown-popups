# About Markdown Popups

## Overview

Sublime Markdown Popups (MdPopups) is a library for Sublime Text plugins.  It utilizes the new plugin API found in ST3
to create popups and phantoms from Markdown or HTML. It requires at least ST3 3124+. MdPopups utilizes Python Markdown
with a couple of special extensions to convert Markdown to HTML that can be used to create popups and/or phantoms.  It
also provides a number of other helpful API commands to aid in creating great popups and phantoms.

MdPopups will use your color scheme to create popups/phantoms that fit your editors look.
